After seeing the relevant training from the Udacity site
I rewrote this project.

Almost all of the Jet Pack components used in this project are based on the mvvm architecture.
for example :


- Room :sunglasses:


- RecyclerView


- LiveData


- ViewModel


- Lifecycle


- Navigation 


- Kotlin coroutines :smiling_imp:


- Unit test :fire:

- ...



It's a small, very simple concept project for training and development so please **fork**.
I'm waiting for your **PULL REQUESTS** :kissing:
